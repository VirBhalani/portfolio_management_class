# JWT Authentication Restored ✅

## Summary
JWT authentication has been fully restored to fix the deployed application. All API calls now include the authentication token.

## Changes Made

### 1. App.js - Authentication Flow Restored ✅
- ✅ Imported Login component
- ✅ Added AuthLayout component for route protection
- ✅ Added login route `/login`
- ✅ Token checking on app load
- ✅ Automatic redirect to login if not authenticated
- ✅ User state management

### 2. Login.js - Environment Variable Added ✅
- ✅ Uses `REACT_APP_API_URL` environment variable
- ✅ Stores JWT token in localStorage
- ✅ Navigates to dashboard after successful login
- ✅ Shows demo credentials

### 3. ModernDashboard.js - JWT Token Restored ✅
- ✅ JWT token added to all API calls
- ✅ Authorization header included
- ✅ User prop restored
- ✅ Welcome message shows user name

### 4. AddInvestment.js - JWT Token Restored ✅
- ✅ JWT token added to investment creation
- ✅ Authorization header included
- ✅ Uses environment variable for API URL

## How It Works

### Authentication Flow
```
1. User visits app → Redirected to /login
2. User enters credentials
3. Login API call with email/password
4. Backend returns JWT token
5. Token stored in localStorage
6. User redirected to dashboard
7. All API calls include token in Authorization header
```

### API Call Structure
```javascript
const token = localStorage.getItem('token');
fetch(url, {
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`
  }
})
```

## Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in Netlify:

```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.onrender.com
```

## Demo Credentials

As shown on the login page:
- **Email**: vir.bhalani23@spit.ac.in
- **Password**: virbhalani

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Commit and Push Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Restore JWT authentication"
git push
```

### 2. Netlify Will Auto-Deploy
- Netlify detects the push
- Builds the app automatically
- Deploys the new version

### 3. Verify Environment Variables
In Netlify Dashboard:
- Go to Site settings → Environment variables
- Verify `REACT_APP_API_URL` is set correctly
- Should point to your backend URL

### 4. Test the Application
1. Visit your Netlify URL
2. Should see login page
3. Enter demo credentials
4. Should redirect to dashboard
5. Try creating a portfolio
6. Try adding investments

## Backend Requirements

Your backend must:
1. ✅ Have `/api/auth/login` endpoint
2. ✅ Return JWT token on successful login
3. ✅ Verify JWT token on protected routes
4. ✅ Have CORS enabled for Netlify domain

### Backend CORS Configuration
```javascript
app.use(cors({
  origin: [
    'https://your-app.netlify.app',
    'http://localhost:3000'
  ],
  credentials: true
}));
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still Can't Create Portfolio

**Check:**
1. Are you logged in? (Check localStorage for token)
2. Is the token valid? (Check browser console for 401 errors)
3. Is backend accessible? (Check Network tab in DevTools)
4. Is CORS configured? (Check for CORS errors in console)

**Solution:**
```bash
# Open browser console (F12)
# Check for errors
# Verify token exists:
localStorage.getItem('token')

# Check API URL:
console.log(process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL)
```

### Issue: Login Fails

**Check:**
1. Is backend URL correct in Netlify env vars?
2. Is backend running?
3. Are credentials correct?

**Solution:**
- Verify `REACT_APP_API_URL` in Netlify
- Test backend directly: `curl https://your-backend.com/api/auth/login`
- Check backend logs

### Issue: 401 Unauthorized Errors

**Cause:** Token expired or invalid

**Solution:**
1. Logout and login again
2. Clear localStorage: `localStorage.clear()`
3. Refresh the page

### Issue: CORS Errors

**Cause:** Backend not allowing Netlify domain

**Solution:**
Update backend CORS to include your Netlify URL:
```javascript
origin: ['https://your-app.netlify.app']
```

## Testing Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create .env file
echo "REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5004" > .env

# Start dev server
npm start

# Should redirect to login
# Use demo credentials to login
```

## What's Different from Before?

### Before (No Auth)
- ❌ No login page
- ❌ Direct access to dashboard
- ❌ No JWT tokens
- ❌ API calls failed (401 errors)

### Now (With Auth)
- ✅ Login page required
- ✅ Protected routes
- ✅ JWT tokens in all API calls
- ✅ API calls work correctly

## Security Notes

- JWT token stored in localStorage
- Token sent with every API request
- Backend validates token
- Token expires after set time (check backend config)
- User must re-login after expiration

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Changes committed
2. 🔄 Push to GitHub
3. 🔄 Netlify auto-deploys
4. 🔄 Test login functionality
5. 🔄 Test portfolio creation
6. 🔄 Test investment addition
7. ✅ App should work fully!

## Support

If issues persist:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check Network tab for failed requests
3. Verify backend is running
4. Verify environment variables in Netlify
5. Check backend logs for authentication errors
